About This Project

This is a collaborative project repository for CS1 Group 4. The project is designed to help students understand how Git and Gitea are used for version control while working as a team. It allows members to practice managing files, tracking changes, and collaborating effectively.

Documentation

This repository serves as a learning resource for using Git and Gitea in collaborative development. It helps students learn how to commit changes, push updates, use branches, and handle merge conflicts in an organized way.

PART 9: Reflection Questions

1. What is the difference between commit and push?
   
	•	Commit saves changes to your local repository after selecting files and writing a commit message. It helps track your progress on your own computer.
	•	Push sends those committed changes to the remote Gitea repository so other group members can see and use them.
In simple terms, committing stores your work locally, while pushing shares it with others.

3. Why are branches important?

Branches are important because they allow developers to work on features or changes without affecting the main project. They make it possible for multiple members to work at the same time and test ideas safely. Once the work is ready, changes can be merged back into the main branch to keep the project stable and organized.

5. What causes merge conflicts?

Merge conflicts happen when two or more people edit the same part of a file and Git cannot automatically decide which changes to keep. When this occurs, the user must manually resolve the conflict to ensure that all changes are correctly combined before committing and pushing.
